# Angular test tasks

## Tools

You have following libraries installed to simplify starting:
* angular
* angular-loader
* angular-mocks
* angular-route
* html5-boilerplate
* bootstrap


## Test task: Quiz

Using Angular.js create a simple Quiz application that will allow user to login, answer questions and see his score (results).

No backend is required for following steps, simple mockups or dummy-services would suffice.

* Create Login screen with Email/Password fields 
* After login user would see a simple Quiz consisting of 5 questions
* User should answer each question (Each question should contain 2..5 possible answers)
* After final step show user his results (for simplification we can assume that first answer in each question was always the right one)
